# README

These were written to allow a beginner to get an ELK stack running in Docker without having to know much about Docker.

## Notes

* ELK_notes.pdf is a PDF version of ELK_notes.md.  The PDF file was created by running the MD file through PanDoc.
* main.sh, when run, will create and populate the /elk folder with a number of other scripts which can be used to build/run an ELK stack in Docker.

## Installation

* Make main.sh executable (''chmod u+x main.sh'') and run it as root (''sudo ./main.sh'')
* Follow the notes in the PDF
